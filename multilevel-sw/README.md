# multilevel-stepped-wedge

The sas and excel program for the sample size and power calculations as described in the paper 
"Sample size calculation for stepped wedge cluster randomized trials with more than two levels of clustering"
in Clinical Trials Journal (accepted 2019).   

The lowest level is measured cross-sectionally, the upmost level (cluster) as cohort, intermediate levels up to a certain level are measured cross-sectional, and above that level a cohort.  

See the paper for more explanation (also provided here as CT-18...docx).
